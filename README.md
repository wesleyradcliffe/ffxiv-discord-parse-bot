# ffxiv-discord-parse-bot
Gonna write a discord parse bot so i dont have to keep copy pasting that shit into discord.

Written in ecma6 more or less. Uses babel to compile. 

copy config_example.js to config.js or this wont work. 
add your discord bot token to config.js

to run locally:
npm install
npm start

to run on a server:
npm install
npm run build
npm run server
